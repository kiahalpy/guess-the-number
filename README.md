# guess-the-number
A game... to guess the number!
I joined two examples of guessing number games that I found in classes.
The first contained only the instructions for correcting the number. 
The other said when the numbers were bigger or smaller.
I Combined the best of both. 
My first ruby ​​code so most likely it could have been done simpler (:
